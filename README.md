# Disney<sup>+<sup>_clone 
	I like real world projects (twitter, facebook), some times i wondered how they create this one? how much knowledge need to create like this? that's the begining stage of starting this project. And i finally finished the "Disney-plus" clone static website project today. I'm so happy and exicited, thanks to [clever programmer](https://www.youtube.com/c/CleverProgrammer) inspire to build this project.
